# Description
Mostly same as mentioned in the documents if different mentioned in assumptions.
## Running the Shell

    1. run `make` 
    2. run `./main`

# Assumptions
-> If a wrong argument is passed with warp it wont show anychange rather remain at current directory, in other words it wont return a perror statement.
-> Similar is the case with seek, if a file or directory is not found it will return to the initial directory without printing anything.
-> peek -l -a can be executed with any number spaces between them but there should be only 1 space between l and a.
-> If pastevents execute calls an index which is more than elements in history it returns an error
-> when background process ends message is not printed
